  - Privacy-focused data collection
  - Performance metrics gathering
  - Feature usage statistics

## Implementation Approach

For each improvement, follow this implementation process:

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Define detailed requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **Design**: Create design documents with class diagrams, data flows, and UI mockups
3. **Implementation**: Write code with comprehensive documentation
4. **Testing**: Create unit and integration tests
5. **Documentation**: Update user documentation and README
6. **Review**: Conduct code review and user testing
7. **Release**: Package and release with proper versioning

## Prioritization Criteria

When deciding which improvements to implement first, consider:

1. **User Impact**: How much will this improve the user experience?
2. **Implementation Effort**: How complex is the implementation?
3. **Dependencies**: Does this depend on other improvements?
4. **Technical Debt**: Will this reduce or increase technical debt?
5. **Strategic Alignment**: Does this align with the application's vision?
