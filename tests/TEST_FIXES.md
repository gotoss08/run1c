## Issue: Failed Tests in Validation Modules

When implementing the unit testing framework, we encountered failures in the following tests:

1. `ErrorHandlerTest.Validate1CPathTest`
2. `ConfigTest.Custom1CStarterPathTest`
3. `ConfigTest.Is1CStarterValidTest`

## Root Cause

All failures were related to the same underlying issue: the tests were creating test files with names that did not match the validation criteria in the actual implementation.

Specifically:
- In the test setup, we were creating test files named `test_1cestart.exe`
- Both `Config::is1CStarterValid()` and `ErrorHandler::validate1CPath()` require the filename to be exactly `1cestart.exe`

This naming mismatch caused the validation functions to return `false` when the tests expected `true`.

## Solution

The fix was straightforward - we updated the test file setup to create files with the correct name that would pass validation:

1. In `test_config.cpp`, changed:
   ```cpp
   test1CStarterPath = "test_1cestart.exe";
   ```
   to:
   ```cpp
   test1CStarterPath = "1cestart.exe";
   ```

2. Similarly, in `test_error_handler.cpp`, made the same change.

## Validation

After applying these changes, all 22 tests now pass successfully, confirming that the validation logic works as intended when the filename matches the required pattern.

## Lessons Learned

1. When writing tests that validate file paths or filenames, ensure that the test data matches the expected format in the validation functions.
   
2. For tests that verify validation rules, it's important to understand the exact criteria being checked in the implementation.

3. Test fixtures should create test scenarios that accurately match the requirements of the code being tested.

## Future Considerations

Consider adding additional tests with invalid filenames to verify that the validation functions correctly reject files that don't match the required patterns.
